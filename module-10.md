    icon: file-word text-primary
    url: https://blackboard.albany.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_7504068_1&course_id=_170260_1&group_id=&mode=cpview
    description: This is the first draft of your proposal which includes your introduction, literature review, methods and conclusion. See the Proposal Outline document for specific instructions. This is just a drop box so that you have something to peer-review. I advise you to include your revised introduction and literature review sections, but the important part here is your methods section and conclusion.
    due: November 14 @ 11:59pm

  - title: Revise Your Introduction and Literature Review Sections
    icon: file-word text-primary
    url: https://blackboard.albany.edu
    description: You must make the changes from my feedback to your introduction and literature review sections. You must also add a cover letter to your final draft (not due for peer-review) that explains how you made the changes. This only needs to be 1 paragraph that lets me know you read and made the changes. It should not be a list of the specific changes, but rather an overall summary of how you modified the sections. There is no drop box for this at this time, but you will include it on your final submission.
    due: December 5 @ 11:59pm
